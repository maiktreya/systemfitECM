\usage{
uecm_systemfit(
  formula,
  data,
  grouping,
  nlags = 1,
  method = "SUR",
  method_solv = "EViews",
  iterations = 1,
  inst_list = NULL
)

uecm_systemfit(
  formula,
  data,
  grouping,
  nlags = 1,
  method = "SUR",
  method_solv = "EViews",
  iterations = 1,
  inst_list = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula of the form `y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2`, where `y` is the
dependent variable, `x1` and `x2` are independent variables, and `z1` and
`z2` are instrumental variables (optional).  The formula *must* be
explicitly specified; using a character string for the formula is *not*
supported by `systemfit`.}

\item{data}{A `data.table` object containing the data.}

\item{grouping}{A character vector of length two, specifying the columns
defining panel units and time periods (e.g., `c("reporter", "year")`).}

\item{nlags}{An integer specifying the number of lags to include.  Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the desired estimation method.
Must be one of "SUR" (default), "OLS", "2SLS", or "3SLS".}

\item{method_solv}{A character string indicating the solution method for 3SLS.
Default is "EViews".  See `systemfit.control` for other options.}

\item{iterations}{An integer indicating the number of iterations for the
estimation. Defaults to 1.}

\item{inst_list}{A character vector of instruments for 2SLS and 3SLS methods.
The first element should be the name of the endogenous variable being instrumented.
The remaining elements are the instrument names. This is crucial for correct
instrument specification.  Ignored if `method` is "SUR" or "OLS".}

\item{col_names}{A character vector of column names.}

\item{dt}{A data.table object containing the data.}
}
\value{
A model result from systemfit.

A model result from `systemfit`.
}
\description{
Computes the Unrestricted Error Correction Model (UECM) for use with `systemfit`.
 This function estimates a single equation from a system of equations.  It's designed
 for panel data.
